### Explanation of the File Structure

*   **`ai_models/`:** Contains modules related to AI/ML models.
    *   `object_detection.py`: Code for object detection from satellite imagery.
    *   `population_density.py`: Code for population density estimation.
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes `ai_models` a Python package.
*   **`data_processing/`:** Contains modules for data acquisition, preprocessing, and manipulation.
    *   `geojson_handler.py`: Functions for loading, processing, and saving GeoJSON data.
    *   `image_utils.py`: Functions for handling image data (e.g., loading, resizing, preprocessing).
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes `data_processing` a Python package.
*   **`utils/`:** Contains utility modules.
    *   `config.py`: Defines project-wide configuration settings (e.g., file paths, API keys, model parameters).
    *   `logging.py`: Sets up logging for the project.
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes `utils` a Python package.
*   **`main.py`:** The main script that orchestrates the project. It imports functions from the other modules and defines the main workflow.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** A list of all the Python packages required by the project. This makes it easy to install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **`README.md`:** This file!  It provides a description of the project, instructions on how to set it up and run it, and other relevant information.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd digital_twin_project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure the project:**
    *   Edit the `utils/config.py` file to set the appropriate file paths, API keys, and other configuration settings.  *Crucially, ensure your data files are located where specified in `config.py`*.
    *   Obtain and place satellite imagery (e.g., `slum_image.jpg`) in the project directory or adjust the path in `config.py`.
    *   Create or acquire a GeoJSON file (e.g., `slum_area.geojson`) representing the slum area and place it in the project directory.
    *   Create a CSV file (e.g., `population_data.csv`) containing training data for the population density estimation model.

## Running the Project

1.  **Run the `main.py` script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will execute the main workflow, which includes:
    *   Loading GeoJSON data.
    *   Performing object detection on satellite imagery.
    *   Training and running the population density estimation model.
    *   Logging the results to the console and a log file (if logging is enabled).

## Code Documentation

The code is documented using docstrings.  Refer to the individual Python files for detailed information about each function and class. Example:
```python
def load_geojson(geojson_file):
    """Loads a GeoJSON file into a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame.

    Args:
        geojson_file (str): Path to the GeoJSON file.

    Returns:
        geopandas.GeoDataFrame: A GeoDataFrame containing the GeoJSON data, or None if there's an error.
    """
