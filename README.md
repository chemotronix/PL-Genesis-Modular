# Secured AI Autonomous Infrastructure: Roadmap for Building Smart Cities

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a digital replica of communities to facilitate inclusive planning and decision-making of smart cities.  The digital twin integrates various data sources, including satellite imagery, GIS data, and potentially smart payment data, and utilizes AI/ML models to extract valuable insights. The project provides policymakers, NGOs, and other stakeholders with a platform to simulate interventions and assess their potential impact on the community as we build future cities.

## Problem Statement

Lack of comprehensive data about informal settlements limits effective and inclusive urban planning. This project addresses this issue by creating a data-rich digital representation of a slum.

## Solution

This project prototypes a digital twin (a digital replica) of a community, focusing on:

*   **Data Integration:** Combining satellite imagery, GIS data (if available), and potentially smart payment data.
*   **3D Representation:** (Future Enhancement) Building a 3D model of the slum, including informal structures, utilities, and environmental features.  Currently focuses on GIS layers.
*   **AI/ML Insights:** Utilizing AI/ML to extract information from satellite imagery (e.g., object detection, land use classification, population density estimation)
*   **Simulation Capabilities:**  Allowing users to simulate interventions (e.g., adding solar panels, improving sanitation, providing access to clean water) and visualize the results.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:**  Primary programming language for data processing, AI/ML, and simulation.
*   **GeoPandas:**  For geospatial data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras:** For deep learning (object detection).
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing.
*   **QGIS:**  For data digitization and visualization (optional).
*   **Unity3D or CesiumJS:**  Visualization platform (choose one).  *Currently this project focuses on the data processing and AI/ML backend, the visualization component is for future work.*
